# DocumentTracker
 Data Analysis of a Document Tracker
 
 The aim of this project is to develop a tool in Python to perform data analysis on a 
document tracker and the objective is to develop proficiency in advanced programming 
concepts. The document tracker tool was developed using object oriented and functional 
programming paradigms making it more robust and manageable.

As specified in the requirement specification, it was developed, tested and executed on 
Linux machine. Implementation was done in Python 3.10 which was installed in the Linux 
machine. Pythonâ€™s wide selection of built-in libraries such as pandas, Tkinter, PIL and 
matplot libraries were used for visualizing and data analysis of the document tracker.

A key assumption is made in this development to identify also like documents, we have 
considered the documents only if they were read for a considerate time and documents 
glanced through are not considered as read.

Here are the python libraries that are used:
o Pandas dataframe is used to perform data handling.
o Matplotlib is used to plot the histogram.
o Tkinter is used to build the GUI.
o Pycountry_convert is used to retrieve continent details for a country.
o User_agents is used to parse the string data.
o PIL is used to handle images.
o Graphviz is used to draw the graph.
